## Lab 8

This lab was a part of our Project 7. It involved working with node-fetch and fastify. We also worked with JSONPlaceholder to practice using Promises though _.then_ and _.catch_ chain methods.

### Goals and Objectives

- Create lab file and initialize Node.js folder
- Install node-fetch package
- Add fastify starter code
- Add fastify and node-fetch require statements
- Fetch JSONPlaceholder data

### The following is an example of the commands used to initialize Node.js and node-fetch
```
npm init -y
npm install --save fastify node-fetch
```
